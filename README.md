## Description

Customize the column sizes of your Obsidian Bases. You can only customize a base file. The columns you resized affect embedded Bases.

This uses a parser that I created to manipulate the contents of the base file.

> You should make sure that each table view has a unique name when using this plugin

## Functions

-   **Edit column sizes**: Edit all the column sizes one by one of the selected base file and selected view.
-   **Distribute column sizes to window size**: Takes the window size and divides it to the number of present columns.
-   **Distribute column sizes by custom size**: Takes a size to assign to all the columns.
